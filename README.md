# Automated Weighted Decision Matrix
 
 
## Purpose

This is a tool created using Python 3 and th XlsxWriter library that allows users to perform a Weighted Decision Matrix inside a terminal. It is an efficient and simple process where the user inputs specific design criteria, appropriate weights, raw scores, and justifications, and this program automatically calculates the final score and identifies the most optimal solution based on which concept scored the highest. Once the user is satisfied with the outcome, the matrix is saved as a .xlsx file.
